## Known Issues / WIP

âš  Notifications are shown as if from an app named [SnoreToast](https://github.com/KDE/snoretoast). This is the library used for displaying notifications on Windows 10 from Node. Work is under way in figuring out a better way to uniquely identify the notifier.

âš  Launching the app brings up a mildly annoying console window. Work is under way for surpressing it.
